# Bamazon
In this Amazon-style CLI, the user is able to select an item from a list to purchase. Afterwards, they are prompted to specify a quantity, confirm their order is correct, and choose a next step (buy another item or quit).

The list of items was generated by hand in MySQL Workbench. The app updates stock quantity in the bamazon database after user confirms a purchase. 

The purpose of this app was to practice MySQL commands.
